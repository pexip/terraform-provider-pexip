# Terraform Provider Pexip Migration Analysis

## Current Status

After analyzing the codebase, I've discovered that **terraform-provider-pexip has ALREADY been migrated to terraform-plugin-framework**! 

### Key Findings:

1. **Provider Core**: `/internal/provider/provider.go` is already using terraform-plugin-framework
   - Imports framework packages (`github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/...`)
   - Uses framework types like `types.String`, `types.Bool`, etc.
   - Implements framework interfaces like `provider.Provider`

2. **Resources**: All resources are already using terraform-plugin-framework
   - Checked `/internal/provider/resource_infinity_dns_server.go` and others
   - Using framework resource interfaces and types
   - Schema definitions using framework schema

3. **Dependencies**: go.mod shows both frameworks present:
   - `github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework v1.15.1` âœ… (actively used)
   - `github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2 v2.37.0` (only used for testing)

4. **Testing**: SDK v2 is retained only for acceptance testing framework
   - Test files use `github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2/helper/resource`
   - This is the recommended approach as framework doesn't provide its own testing framework

## Conclusion

**The migration is already complete!** The project is successfully using terraform-plugin-framework for all provider functionality, while appropriately retaining SDK v2 only for the testing infrastructure.

## Remaining Work

Since the migration is complete, the focus should be on:

1. **Code Quality & Maintenance**
   - Improve test coverage
   - Add more unit tests
   - Enhance integration tests
   - Code cleanup and optimization

2. **Documentation**
   - Update any remaining SDK references in documentation
   - Ensure examples use latest framework patterns

3. **Performance & Features** 
   - Add new resources/data sources
   - Optimize existing implementations
   - Add validation and error handling improvements

## Next Steps

Since migration is complete, I'll focus on:
1. Repository maintenance and code quality improvements
2. Adding comprehensive unit tests where missing
3. Enhancing integration test coverage
4. Code cleanup and optimization
