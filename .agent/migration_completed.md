## Migration Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The terraform-provider-pexip has been successfully migrated from Terraform Plugin SDK v2 to Terraform Plugin Framework.

## What Was Done

### ✅ Provider Core (Already Complete)
- Provider configuration and schema using Plugin Framework
- Authentication and client setup working
- Resource and data source registration complete

### ✅ Resource Implementation (Already Complete)

- CRUD operations implemented with Framework patterns
- Schema definitions using Plugin Framework syntax
- Validation using Plugin Framework validators

### ✅ Data Source Implementation (Already Complete)
- InfinityManagerConfigDataSource migrated to Plugin Framework

### ✅ Test Migration (Completed Today)
- Migrated 73+ test files from `terraform-plugin-sdk/v2` to `terraform-plugin-testing`
- Updated imports and removed SDK v2 dependencies
- Removed manual TF_ACC environment variable setting
- Fixed special cases like CheckDestroy functions
- All tests verified working with Plugin Framework testing

### ✅ Dependency Management
- Removed `github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2` from direct dependencies
- Added `github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-testing v1.13.3`
- SDK v2 remains as indirect dependency through testing framework (normal)

- **Provider API**: All resources and data sources function identically
- **Testing**: All existing test patterns preserved and working

## Files Changed

- **go.mod**: Updated dependencies
- **73+ test files**: Migrated to Plugin Framework testing
- **Created migration tooling**: Scripts and documentation in `.agent/` directory

## Next Steps

The migration is complete! The provider is now fully running on Terraform Plugin Framework and ready for:

1. Future development using Plugin Framework patterns
2. Taking advantage of new Plugin Framework features
3. Continued maintenance and enhancement

## Branch Information

Migration completed on branch: `plugin-framework-testing`
